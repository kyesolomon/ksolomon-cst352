        <p>A Computer Science major teaches students with a familiarity of<br />
        basic computer science knowledge paired with applicable information<br /> 
        on IT skills. Students are trained for jobs in computing technology<br /> 
        industries or to get accepted into grad school.</p>
        <p>Here, students learn the most basic CS concepts<br /> 
        while applying what they've learned to solve problems. Collaborating, <br />
        team work and speaking effectively are included in the learning curriculum <br />
        with mostly projects in a state-of-the-art BIT building w/ lots of PC's.<br />
        Students start by getting similar sets of core classes to establish a strong <br />
        foundation in CS, then by taking classes in one of three<br />
        specific areas: software engineering, network and security, or game development.<br /> 
        The requirements give students the chance to <br />
        get concepts and learn skills in not just a single concentration, making <br />
        them to well rounded CS pro's if they graduate.</p>
